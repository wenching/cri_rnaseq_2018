## Dataset

The RNA-seq data used in this tutorial are from a [published paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25499759) that explores PRDM11 and lymphomagenesis. We will use the data from the PRDM11 knockdown and wildtype samples. You are welcome to explore the full dataset on GEO ([GSE56065](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE56065)).

### Prerequisites

* [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
* [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)
* [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/)
* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)
* [BigDataScript](https://pcingola.github.io/BigDataScript/)

### Installing

```bash
# CAUTION

**THIS PACKAGE IS LARGE, PLEASE DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT TO YOUR HOME DIRECTORY**  
**USE OTHER LOCATION LIKE /CRI/HPC/username**

# download the package via 'git clone'
git clone git@github.com:wenching/cri_rnaseq_2018.git


# Or, download the latest package via 'wget'
wget https://github.com/wenching/cri_rnaseq_2018/archive/master.tar.gz .

# uncompress the tarball file, if using wget
# tar -zxvf master.tar.gz

# change folder name, if using wget
# mv cri_rnaseq_2018-master cri_rnaseq_2018


# change working directory to the package directory
cd cri_rnaseq_2018

# load modules
$ module purge;module load gcc udunits python/3.6.0 R/3.5.0; module update

# This step is optional but it will install all necessary R packages ahead.
# In case the pipeline was terminated due to the failure of R package installation later when running the pipeline.
$ Rscript --vanilla SRC/R/util/prerequisite.packages.R

# create directories and generate all necessary scripts
$ bash Build_RNAseq.DLBC.sh

# run the entire pipeline with just this command
$ bash Submit_cri_rnaseq_2018.sh
```
